OGK Data Pipeline and Volunteering Engagement Proposal
Prepared for: Mendy and Mushka Plotkin, OGK Dallas
Prepared by: Chase Fagen & Kyle Shechtman, Data Buddies Solutions
Date: November 21st, 2025

1. Project Overview This project will establish a modern, scalable data ecosystem that empowers OGK to make data-driven decisions, increase volunteer engagement, and maximize meal allocation.
The system will consist of three core components:
The Data Pipeline
Scalable Collection: Establish a reliable process for aggregating operational data (meals served, event details, volunteer counts).
Infrastructure: Deploy a central database and standardized intake forms to ensure data accuracy from day one.
Event Management & Outreach
Publishing: Generate professional event announcements including date, time, location, and capacity.
Coordination: Manage nonprofit partner requirements and meal sign-ups.
Outreach: Automate personalized invitations to volunteers to boost registration rates.
Volunteer Engagement Portal
Gamification: Visual leaderboards allowing volunteers to track service hours and milestones.
Retention: Automated email journeys tailored to specific stages of the volunteer lifecycle (new, active, at-risk).
Incentives: "Superstar" rewards program for top performers and re-engagement campaigns for inactive users.

2. Project Phases and Deliverables
Phase 1: Database Creation & Infrastructure
Data Schema Design: Design and build a relational database to store core entities: Volunteers, Events, Nonprofit Partners, and Meal Logistics.
Operational Intake Forms: Creation of standardized digital forms for staff to easily input post-event data
Phase 2: Event Automation & Outreach
Event Publishing Engine: An AI workflow to generate professional event outreach containing date, time, and capacity limits.
Partner Coordination Portal: A simplified workflow for nonprofit partners to request meals or manage sign-ups.
Automated Outreach System: Setup of email triggers that send invitations to volunteers as soon as an event is published.
Phase 3: Social Dashboard & Volunteer Engagement
Volunteer Portal: A user-friendly, mobile-responsive dashboard where volunteers can view their history.
Visual Leaderboards: Implementation of social features displaying "Top Volunteers," "Hours Contributed," or "Meals Facilitated" to drive friendly competition.
Milestone Automation: "Smart" email journeys that automatically congratulate volunteers when they hit specific targets (e.g., 10th event, 100 hours).
Re-engagement Workflows: automated "We miss you" sequences triggered when a volunteer has been inactive for a set period (e.g., 60 days).
Phase 4: Testing, Observability & Handoff
User Acceptance Testing: A guided period where OGK staff test the system to identify bugs or workflow friction before the official launch.
Final Deployment: Live launch of the system and handoff of all administrative credentials.
